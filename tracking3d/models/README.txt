ACTS-MU10-PT1000-T50.h5
The corresponding notebook is ACTS-MU10-PT1000-T50.ipynb.
Stores the weights and details of a neural network model defined in keras 1.
The network consists of 3 Bidirectional GRU with 256 units each.
The input shape is (200, 3), where each row is a hit and each column is a
permutation of ("phi", "r", "z").
