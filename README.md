# HEP.TrkX

Github code repository for the HEP.TrkX project, exploring and developing
machine learning algorithms for tracking in High Energy Physics.

There are a few ongoing projects in this repo currently:
* rnnlhc: Using LSTMs to model dynamics of a track and predict 3D hit
  spacepoints.
* houghlike: Jean-Roch's work on detector-image transformations
* discrete\_extraps: Predict hit locations on a discrete detector for track
  finding.
